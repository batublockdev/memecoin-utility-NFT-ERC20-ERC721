# ChocoNFT - Smart Contract

## Introduction

ChocoNFT is a smart contract based on the ERC-721 standard, implemented on the Ethereum network. Its purpose is to allow users to create (mint), sell, and buy NFTs that represent different towns in Choc√≥, Colombia. To mint an NFT, users must hold a minimum amount of ChocoCoin (an ERC-20 token). Additionally, NFT owners can list their NFTs for sale by setting a price in ChocoCoin, and other users can purchase them securely.

## Features

- **NFT Creation**: Any user who holds at least the required minimum amount of ChocoCoin can mint an NFT.
- **Predefined URI Assignment**: Each NFT receives a unique identifier with predefined information upon creation.
- **Listing for Sale**: NFT owners can list their assets on the marketplace by setting a price in ChocoCoin.
- **Buying NFTs**: Users can purchase NFTs by paying the listed price in ChocoCoin. The transaction is securely processed between the buyer and seller.

## Smart Contract Details

### File: ChocoNft.sol

This contract defines the necessary functions for minting, listing, and trading NFTs.

### How to Deploy the Contract

To deploy the contract, use the following code:

```solidity
vm.startBroadcast();
ChocoCoin coin = new ChocoCoin();
ChocoNft chocoNft = new ChocoNft(_tokenURIs, address(coin), 10);
vm.stopBroadcast();
return (chocoNft, coin);
```

## Prerequisites

To work with this project, you need:

- **Solidity** version 0.8.0 or higher
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts** (for security and compatibility features)
- **Foundry or Hardhat** (for testing and deploying the contract)

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to install and configure the project:

1. Clone the repository to your computer:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/ChocoNFT.git
   cd ChocoNFT
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Compile the contracts to ensure there are no errors:
   ```sh
   forge build  # Using Foundry
   ```

## How to Use the Contract

### Minting an NFT

To create a new NFT, call the `mint` function:

```solidity
chocoNft.mint();
```

### Listing an NFT for Sale

If you own an NFT, you can list it for sale by specifying a price in ChocoCoin:

```solidity
chocoNft.listForSale(tokenId, price);
```

### Buying an NFT

If an NFT is listed for sale, you can purchase it by paying its price in ChocoCoin:

```solidity
chocoNft.buyNFT(tokenId);
```

## Possible Errors and Their Causes

Here are some errors that may occur when interacting with the contract:

- `ChocoNft_NotEnough_token_tomint`: Occurs when the user does not have enough ChocoCoins to mint an NFT.
- `ChocoNft_Nottheowner`: Only the NFT owner can list it for sale.
- `ChocoNft_Price_cant_be_0`: The sale price cannot be zero.
- `ChocoNft_NFT_NotForSale`: The NFT you are trying to buy is not listed for sale.
- `ChocoNft__TransferFailed`: Token transfer failure between the buyer and seller.

## Security Considerations

When interacting with smart contracts, keep the following in mind:

- Ensure the contract has been audited before investing large amounts of ChocoCoin.
- Verify the contract address on the blockchain to avoid scams.
- Never share your private keys with anyone.
